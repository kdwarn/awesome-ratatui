Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:
- Make sure you put your project in the appropriate category.
- Consider using the [crates.io](https://crates.io) link for libraries and widgets.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- If you filed an issue, add the issue number with a [GitHub closing phrase](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/using-keywords-in-issues-and-pull-requests#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue), so that the issue gets closed automatically (e.g. `closes #123`).

Thank you for your suggestion! 🧀
